# Introduction
The 'Context' visualization, otherwise known as the 'Lego plot' of mutational frequencies, describes the distribution of mutations across batch samples on a given region. Base substitutions are divided into six types to represent the six possible base changes (each type represented by a different color as shown in the “Mutation Type” legend). Substitutions in each type are further subdivided by the 16 possible flanking nucleotides surrounding the mutated base as listed in “Trinucleotide Context” table. The pie chart illustrates the percentage of all mutations types on said batch samples. To visualize data, upload a **TSV** file in the *required* format and use sidebar options to customize the display.

# Context Data (TSV files)

## Batch Sample
The uploaded **TSV** file must match the *required* format as specified below.<br/>
Check the official demo input [here](https://github.com/Nobel-Justin/Oviz-Bio-demo/blob/master/SNV_Context/demo_data/SNV_TSV_file.txt).
- **header**<br/>
  The first line of the file should be a header that contains column names as keys. The header should follow the following format:

    | #contig |  position |  context | ref_allele |  alt_allele | tumor_f |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | chr1  | 101686  | AxA | A | G | 0.113636 |

    - `#contig` and `position` respectively stand for the chromosome and position of the mutation.
    - `context` stands for the trinucleotide context of the mutation.
    - `ref_allele` and `alt_allele` respectively stand for the base before and after the mutation.
    - `tumor_f` is optional and can be replaced by one or multiple keys as long as the value is numeric. The accumulated value in each bin will be calculated and shown in the tooltip. Here `tumor_f` denote the mutation's frequency of inducing tumor.

- **rows**<br/>
  Each row in the file should contain data for one mutation.

## Custom Bed File (optional)

A custom bed file allows user replace the default region used in our website, which is the while genome sequence. We will filter out mutations that are not in the custom region during the calculation.

The uploaded **TSV** file must match the *required* format as specified below.<br/>
Check the official demo input [here](https://github.com/Nobel-Justin/Oviz-Bio-demo/blob/master/SNV_Context/demo_data/user_bustom_region-1.bed) and [here](https://github.com/Nobel-Justin/Oviz-Bio-demo/blob/master/SNV_Context/demo_data/user_bustom_region-2.bed).

- **header**<br/>
  The header should follow the following format:

    | #chr |  startPos |  endPos |
    |---|---|---|
    | chr1  | 11174854  | 11175054 |

# Display Interactions
There are three types of interactions: *Tooltips*, *Transparent Bins* and *Download*.

- **Tooltips**<br/>
    Tooltips shows necessary information of the object the mouse points to.
        - _*bin*_: A tooltip is drawn when the mouse lands on the bottom of a bin. The displayed information include the mutation type and the trinucleotide context represented by this bin, the exact height of the bin and additional information like the tumor frequency mentioned above.
        - _*pie*_: A tooltip is drawn when the mouse moves to a certain arc of the pie chart and shows the exact percentage of the corresponding mutation type among all mutations.
- **Transparent Bins**<br/>
    When the mouse lands on the bottom of a bin, the bottom will be highlighted and all bins before it will become transparent to avoid hindered view.
- **Download**<br/>
  One SVG file will be generated when the '**Download**' button is clicked. Only the default **Dark Theme** is available at this point.

# Sidebar Functions
The sidebar provides diverse options to fine-tune the display, namely managing files, adding labels on bins, choosing base regions and setting the measurements of mutations.

- **Files**
  - __*Manage Files*__: checklist of TSV files uploaded previously, delete or download said TSV files.
  - __*Upload*__: upload batch sample TSV file and the optional bed TSV file. Note that the duplicated file name will be alerted and given a random postfix.
  - __*Choose*__: choose files uploaded previously. Note that this function is ONLY available to registered users (each account has certain storage).
  - __*File Sets*__: allows user to save a batch sample file and a bed file together as a file set. User can also choose to apply one file set from all saved ones.
- **Labels**
  - __*Label Buttons*__: choose a symbol (except for the first and the last button) to enter labeling mode. In this mode, when you click a bar, the corresponding symbol will be added to the bar as annotation.
  - __*Off Button*__: click this button to exit from labeling mode. Re-click to re-enter labeling mode with the last-used symbol. 
  - __*Remove Button*__: click to enter removing mode. In this mode, when you click a bar with symbol, the corresponding symbol will be removed.
- **Setting**<br/>
  - __*Interval*__: choose between the default region and the custom region. If no bed file is provided, the only option is the default whole genome region.
  - __*Y axis*__: provided three measurement of the mutation count, namely the numeric sum of the mutation, mutations per Mb and the percentage among all mutations.
