## LandScape
The 'LandScape' visualization is frequently utilized to provide a systematic illustration of integrative data from multiple layers of batch samples, which are always compared to each other on certain attributes, such as genes and biological pathways mutated in cancers. To visualize data, a CSV file in the required format is needed.
